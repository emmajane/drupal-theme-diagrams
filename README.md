drupal-theme-diagrams
=====================

This package was created in response to my DrupalCon Munich
presentation on base themes in Drupal 7. You can watch the 
presentation here:

The slide deck for the hand out can be viewed here:

Lots of thanks goes to Donna Benjamin (http://kattekrab.net/) 
for her help with Inkscape.

If you have other diagrams you'd like to add (or you'd like
to improve mine) I would love to accept contributions to this
repository.

The images are release as Public Domain. They do not require
attribution and may be used in commercial works. If you would
like to provide attribution, please check the commit logs for
each of the files.
